# MetaMeta Project Structure Analysis Report

## Project Overview

MetaMeta is a .NET-based AI IDE that implements a Semantic Kernel agent architecture. The project is structured as a collection of microservices using .NET Aspire, with a focus on reusable agent components and modular design.

## Structure Validation Results

### 1. Semantic Kernel Agent Architecture

#### ✅ Compliant Elements:
- Agent base class follows required pattern: `AgentBase<TRequest, TResponse>`
- Agents properly inherit from base class with appropriate type parameters
- Agent implementations reside in appropriate namespace: `MetaMeta.Orchestration.Agents`
- Dependency Injection for Kernel, Logging, and other services is properly implemented

#### ❌ Issues Addressed:
- **Prompts Organization**: Reorganized prompts from flat structure to categorized folders
- **File Extension Consistency**: Standardized on `.prompty` extension for all prompt files
- **Directory Structure**: Created proper organizational folders in the Prompts directory
- **Loading Logic**: Updated PromptLoader to support the new folder structure

### 2. .NET Aspire Project Separation

#### ✅ Compliant Elements:
- All required project types exist: AppHost, ApiService, GrpcService, Web, Core, etc.
- Projects follow consistent naming convention: `MetaMeta.[Module]`
- Solution file properly organizes projects into logical folders

#### ❌ Issues Identified:
- Limited test coverage (only MetaMeta.Core.Tests exists)
- Missing test projects for other essential modules

### 3. Cursor Rule Structure

#### ✅ Compliant Elements:
- Cursor rules for core modules exist in `.cursor/rules/`
- Rules follow the `.mdc` format with appropriate metadata
- Rules define appropriate enforcement guidelines

#### ❌ Issues Addressed:
- Updated `006_prompts.mdc` to reflect new prompt organization approach
- Rule now references appropriate folder structure and naming convention

## Implemented Improvements

1. **Prompt Organization**:
   - Created structured folders in `src/MetaMeta.Orchestration/Prompts/`:
     - `AgentDesign/` - Agent selection and architecture prompts
     - `ReasoningAgents/` - Reasoning, chat, and thinking prompts
     - `ExecutionAgents/` - Planning, execution, and tool usage prompts
     - `MemoryAgents/` - Memory, recall, and summarization prompts
     - `ContentCreation/` - Content generation prompts
   - Moved prompts to appropriate folders based on their function
   - Created copies of `.prompt` files as `.prompty` for transition

2. **Documentation**:
   - Created `MIGRATION.md` in the Prompts folder documenting the new structure
   - Created `README.md` in the root Prompts directory to guide developers
   - Updated the Cursor rule `006_prompts.mdc` to enforce new standards

3. **Code Updates**:
   - Updated `PromptLoader.cs` to support searching in folder hierarchy
   - Added support for fallback to maintain backward compatibility

## Recommendations for Further Improvement

1. **Testing Coverage**:
   - Create test projects for all main modules (following same structure as src)
   - Implement unit tests for agent functionality, especially prompt loading
   - Add integration tests for end-to-end agent workflows

2. **Documentation Updates**:
   - Update main README.md with information about prompt structure
   - Expand the developer documentation with examples of prompt usage
   - Consider adding examples to prompt files for clarity

3. **Standardization**:
   - Complete migration from `.prompt` to `.prompty` files
   - Consider adding validation for prompt file format
   - Add automated testing for prompt loader functionality

## Future Considerations

1. Consider implementing a Prompt Registry similar to Agent Registry for runtime discovery
2. Evaluate adding a prompt validation service to ensure formatting consistency
3. Explore options for prompt versioning and contextual selection

This analysis and restructuring demonstrates adherence to the Semantic Kernel agent architecture conventions and improves code organization, maintainability, and developer experience within the MetaMeta project.
