# Cursor Rule: 003_assistants.mdc
# Title: Assistant Development Standards

## Purpose:
Establish standards and structural conventions for creating new AI assistants using the AgentCore runtime. Assistants must be modular, reusable, testable, and follow consistent Prompty + Core patterns. Each assistant functions as a standalone service or library that conforms to MetaMeta’s Copilot runtime.

---

## Requirements

### ✅ Inheritance & Composition
- All assistants MUST inherit from `AgentBase<TRequest, TResponse>` defined in `Core/Agents`
- Each assistant MUST override `ExecuteAsync(TRequest)` to implement core logic
- Agents MUST be registered using `AgentRegistry`

### ✅ Prompty Files
- Prompts MUST be external `.prompty` files stored under `/Prompts`
- Assistant logic MUST NOT contain inline prompt templates
- Prompt files MUST follow Prompty YAML structure and naming (e.g., `PlanningPrompt.prompty`)

### ✅ Folder Layout

```
src/<AssistantName>/
├── Agents/
│   └── <Assistant>.cs
├── Prompts/
│   └── <PromptName>.prompty
├── Controllers/ (optional)
│   └── <AssistantController>.cs
├── Program.cs
├── <AssistantName>.csproj
```

### ✅ Naming Convention
- Assistant projects MUST be named with the suffix `Assistant` (e.g. `PlanningAssistant`)
- Agent class names MUST be PascalCase matching their service directory
- All files MUST be scoped within their respective assistant directory

### ✅ Agent Behavior
- All assistants MUST support async invocation
- JSON input MUST be deserialized to a typed class
- All outputs MUST be returned as structured text or serialized JSON

### ✅ Testability
- Each assistant MUST be testable via unit or integration tests
- Prompts SHOULD be testable with sample inputs + expected output

---

## Recommended Enhancements

- Assistants SHOULD log input/output using shared observability utilities
- Assistants MAY use plugins (Markdown, Voice, File) via Kernel extensions
- Assistants MAY declare metadata for auto-discovery

---

## Enforcement

> Cursor agents enforcing this rule must ensure assistant folders follow naming + structure, inherit from AgentBase<TRequest, TResponse>, and use external .prompty files only. Prompts must be well-formed, version-controlled, and linked in metadata.
