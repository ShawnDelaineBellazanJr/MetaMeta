# Cursor Rule: 004_plugins.mdc
# Title: Plugin Standards for Semantic Kernel Compatibility

## Purpose:
Standardize the structure, safety, and composability of SK-compatible plugins used by assistants. Plugins extend assistant capabilities using the SK `KernelPlugin` interface and should be reusable across assistants and planners.

---

## Requirements

### ✅ Plugin Structure
- All plugins MUST be implemented as a class or service that exposes SKFunction-compatible methods
- Each plugin MUST be loadable via `kernel.ImportPluginFromObject(...)`
- Plugin class names MUST use the suffix `Plugin` (e.g. `MarkdownFormatterPlugin`, `VoiceFormatterPlugin`)

### ✅ Plugin Registration
- Plugins MUST be registered in Program.cs or agent constructors
- Plugin functions MUST declare clear SKFunction attributes or use method naming for discoverability
- Plugins MAY be imported from `Plugins/` and reused across services

### ✅ File & Folder Layout

```
src/Plugins/
├── <PluginName>/
│   ├── <PluginClass>.cs
│   └── [helpers, validators, etc.]
```

### ✅ Safety & Testability
- Plugin methods MUST validate inputs (e.g. empty strings, bad formats)
- Plugin methods SHOULD be testable in isolation
- Plugins SHOULD avoid side effects unless explicitly required (e.g. file writing)

### ✅ Output & Behavior
- All plugin outputs MUST be clean, structured strings or SK return objects
- Plugins SHOULD support async execution

---

## Optional Enhancements

- Plugins MAY include metadata for SK discovery
- Plugins MAY support runtime enable/disable via flags or configuration
- Plugin directories MAY include prompt usage examples

---

## Enforcement

> Cursor agents enforcing this rule must ensure plugin naming, structure, safety practices, and testability. Each plugin must be reusable, composable, and easy to wire into any agent or planner.
