# Cursor Rule: 009_configs.mdc
# Title: Configuration, App Settings, and Environment Strategy

## Purpose:
Standardize app configuration patterns for local dev, containerization, and cloud deployment. Applies to assistant services, runtime, plugins, and orchestration logic.

---

## Requirements

### ✅ Environment Handling
- Each project MUST support `ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT`
- Configuration loading MUST include:
  - `appsettings.json`
  - `appsettings.Development.json`
  - Environment variables
- Secrets MUST NOT be hardcoded; use Azure Key Vault, user secrets, or GitHub secrets

### ✅ Central Config (optional)
- AppHost MAY include shared configuration values for all services
- Common settings (e.g. Azure endpoints) MAY be injected via `IConfiguration`

---

## Folder Layout

```
src/<Service>/
├── appsettings.json
├── appsettings.Development.json
```

---

## Enforcement

> Cursor should ensure environment-aware config, no secrets in source, and testable settings loading per assistant and runtime service.
