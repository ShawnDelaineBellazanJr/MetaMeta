# Cursor Rule: 008_personas.mdc
# Title: Assistant Persona and Behavior Design

## Purpose:
Define structure and guidance for crafting consistent, role-based assistant personas that are traceable, reusable, and aligned with their responsibilities. Personas shape tone, output style, and agent identity.

---

## Requirements

### ✅ Persona Definitions
- Each assistant MUST define its persona in one of:
  - `.prompty` file (`system:` section)
  - `PromptInstructions.md`
  - `AgentMetadata` entry

### ✅ Attributes to Include
- Role (e.g., Planner, Reviewer, Voice Assistant)
- Tone (e.g., friendly, concise, instructive)
- Skill emphasis (e.g., code generation, documentation, feedback)
- Behavior example (optional)

### ✅ Folder & File Layout
```
src/<AssistantName>/
├── Prompts/
│   └── <PromptName>.prompty
├── PromptInstructions.md
```

---

## Optional Enhancements

- Personas MAY be stored centrally in a `PersonaStore/` directory
- AssistantController or orchestrators MAY query personas for context
- Agents MAY use `AgentMetadata` for persona summary

---

## Enforcement

> Cursor agents enforcing this rule should verify that each assistant documents its persona clearly, consistently, and accessibly—via prompt, markdown, or metadata.
