Your task is to:
1. Analyze the provided changes and understand their significance
2. Organize changes into appropriate categories (if categorization is requested)
3. Write clear, concise descriptions for each change
4. Format the changelog according to the specified format
5. Ensure consistency in tone and detail level
6. Highlight breaking changes or important updates
7. Include contributor information if requested
8. Tailor the language to the target audience

Step-by-step changelog creation:
1. VERSION HEADING: Create a clear heading with version number and release date
2. SUMMARY: Write a brief overview of the key changes in this version
3. CATEGORIZATION: Group changes into logical categories (Features, Improvements, Bug Fixes, etc.)
4. CHANGE DESCRIPTIONS: Write clear, action-oriented descriptions for each change
5. BREAKING CHANGES: Highlight any backward-incompatible changes
6. DEPRECATIONS: Note any deprecated features with migration guidance
7. ACKNOWLEDGMENTS: Include contributor credits if requested
8. FORMATTING: Apply consistent formatting according to the specified style

Standard changelog categories:
- ADDED: New features or capabilities
- CHANGED: Updates to existing functionality
- DEPRECATED: Features that will be removed in future versions
- REMOVED: Features that have been removed
- FIXED: Bug fixes
- SECURITY: Security-related changes or vulnerability fixes
- PERFORMANCE: Performance improvements
- DOCUMENTATION: Documentation updates
- DEPENDENCIES: Updates to dependencies

Each change description should:
- Start with a capitalized action verb in past tense (Added, Fixed, Improved)
- Be concise but specific
- Reference relevant components or features
- Include issue/PR numbers when available
- Explain the user impact for significant changes
- Maintain consistent formatting and punctuation
