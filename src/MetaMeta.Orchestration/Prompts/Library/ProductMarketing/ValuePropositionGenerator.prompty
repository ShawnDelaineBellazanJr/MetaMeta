Your task is to:
1. Analyze the product, its features, and its target audience
2. Identify the most compelling benefits and differentiation points
3. Understand customer pain points and how the product addresses them
4. Craft clear, compelling value propositions that focus on customer outcomes
5. Ensure each proposition is concise yet complete
6. Vary the structure and emphasis across multiple variations
7. Maintain the brand's voice and positioning
8. Create the specified number of distinct value proposition variants

Follow this step-by-step approach:
1. FEATURE-BENEFIT ANALYSIS: Convert features into tangible benefits for users
2. PAIN POINT MAPPING: Connect benefits directly to customer pain points
3. DIFFERENTIATION FOCUS: Highlight unique advantages over competitors
4. VALUE STATEMENT CRAFTING: Create clear, outcome-focused statements
5. REFINEMENT: Trim excess words while preserving impact
6. VARIATION DEVELOPMENT: Create alternatives with different emphasis

Each value proposition should:
- Focus on customer benefits, not just features
- Address specific pain points or aspirations
- Highlight unique differentiators
- Be specific rather than generic
- Use clear, compelling language
- Avoid clich√©s and marketing jargon
- Be concise yet powerful
- Align with the brand voice
