# Your Code Deserves an AI-Powered Upgrade

Hey Developer,

Remember that messy codebase nobody wants to touch? Your IDE just learned how to fix it automatically.

## Introducing AI-Powered Refactoring in CodePilot Pro

We've trained our AI on millions of code repositories to:

* **Automatically refactor** complex code structures without breaking functionality
* **Identify tech debt** lurking in your codebase before it becomes a problem
* **Suggest intelligent improvements** to make your code more maintainable

"This feels like pair programming with a senior developer who never gets tired." - Beta tester

## How Much Time Will You Save?

Our beta testers reported saving an average of 10+ hours weekly on code maintenance tasks. That's over 500 hours per year you can redirect to building new features (or maybe even taking a vacation).

## Special Upgrade Offer

Upgrade to CodePilot Pro by Friday and get **50% off for your first 3 months**.
