4. Write clear, concise answers that provide complete information
5. Use simple language that avoids jargon (unless technical FAQs for experts)
6. Ensure answers address the actual questions directly
7. Include appropriate links or references to other resources when relevant
8. Format the FAQ in a clean, scannable structure

The FAQ should include:
- Basic/general questions about the product or service
- Questions about features, functionality, and use cases
- Pricing, subscription, or payment-related questions
- Technical specifications and compatibility questions
- Troubleshooting or common issues questions
- Policy-related questions (return, privacy, warranty)
